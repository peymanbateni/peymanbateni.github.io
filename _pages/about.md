I'm a Computer Science Master's student in at the [University of British Columbia](), specializing in Machine Learning. I'm currently working on Learning with Less Labels under dual supervision of [Dr. Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/) and [Dr. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/) as part of the [UBC Probabilistic Programming Lab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci/research-groups/programming-languages-artificial-intelligence-plai) and the [UBC Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.cs.ubc.ca/). 

My research interests lie mainly at the cross section of Deep Learning, Probabilistic Programming and Computer Vision. Recently, I've mainly focused on problems in meta-learning, few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning with respect to image classification and object detection.

I recently completed my Bachelor's studies at UBC. Over the course of my undergrad, I had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Guissepe Carenini](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/) on discourse coherence analysis, and [Dr. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/), with whom I worked on visual sentiment analysis. Earlier, I collaborated with [Dr. Laks V.S. Lakshmanan](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~laks/) on scalable database indexing and search algorithms.

In addition to my research, I often indulge in various entrepeurial endevours. I recently founded and currently lead [Beam Engage](https://www.beamengage.com) where I work on automating social media management solutions. Additionally, I'm a Founding Partner at the Vancouver-based educational firm [A+ Expert](https://www.aplus-expert.com). Previously, I served as Co-Founder and CTO of [Cleeck](https://www.cleeck.com) in Toronto, and prior to that, I led the game development startup [Lol Labs](https://thelollabs.com).

I'm always interested in meeting and collaborating with other AI-driven researchers. Got a good project idea? Let's discuss it over [email](mailto:peyman.bateni@alumni.ubc.ca)!
